# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

All you need to know in order to change static text (and its translations) on the website, is where to find the translations. References to text fields that need translation in <code>html.erb</code> templates are formatted as <code>t('path.to.exact.field')</code> or <code>t('.relative_path_starting_on_current_page')</code>. The content that's returned from this function depends on the current language selected by the user. Translations are stored in the <code style='font-weight:bold'>en.yml</code> and <code style='font-weight:bold'>ar.yml</code> files (in <code style='font-weight:bold'>config/locales</code>), for English and Arabic translations, respectively. Each file has the same structure, and text is organized according to the pages of the website."
